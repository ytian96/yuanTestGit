Notes: Feel free to just do this activity on one person's repository. We will be
going over merge conflicts and how to resolve them using GitHub Desktop!
Remember, a merge conflict happens when two or more people make an edit on the 
same file and Git doesn't know which change to keep!

In this activity, you will play 5 games of rock paper scissors with your 
partner. Don't look at each other screens, but when you both have your answer 
written directly after the game # (either yourname - rock, yourname - paper, or
yourname - scissors), feel free to push at the same time. You will run into a 
merge conflict! Solve the merge conflict by keeping the winning hand. 
Then repeat 4 more times. Who won the best of five? :D
